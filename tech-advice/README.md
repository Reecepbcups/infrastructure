### If you are a beginner 

- Learn how to teach yourself. All devs/IT people do is Google. Half of us have no clue what we are doing (impostor syndrome) so its normal

- Learn to learn by doing, not watching. Actually, implement what you watch whether it's a new programming language or a server.
 - Learn Python 3. Plenty of YT videos. If you want to purchase a course, "Udemy Automate the Boring Stuff"
 
Python is good for scripting, and automation. Can be used for software development, micro applications, and server automation.
Also good as it is Java-like and runs most devices. Java runs the internet and IoT. So you can learn java after you learn Classes in Python

 - If you want to get into servers, learn Linux. You can dual boot Linux on a windows PC, this will teach more adv. skills such as partitions, disk management, GRUB bootloader, ISO flashing, etc (not as scary as it seems, most here you only have to know the surface level of what it does, most tools automate now)

 - With Linux, you can purchase a Virtual Private Server from somewhere like OVH cloud, Hetzner (cheapest), or BloomHost. Then just pick something like Debian-9 or -10 on it. This will teach you SSH, FTP, websites, BASH scripting, etc. Then you can run databases like SQL to interact with programs & run a website via apache or Nginx.
 - If you want the best performance, try Arch Linux ( https://anarchyinstaller.gitlab.io/ , or use Hetzner installimage )

overall there is a lot to learn, don't get overwhelmed. It comes with time. There is no right way for IT other than just learning Python programming first (basic English syntax essentially) and expanding from there
